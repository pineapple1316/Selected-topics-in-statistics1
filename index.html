            <li>week1: Jan 10th, no class due to SDS retreat.</li>
            <li>week2: Jan 15th, I will present the famous EM algorithm paper, focusing on historical background, why it is a breakthru, and impacts etc. </li>
            <li>week2: Jan 17th, 10 minutes 1v1 meeting with student for discussion of his/her chosen paper. TA will arrange this.</li>
            <li>Week6: Feb 12th, I will spend first hour on the AoS on EM convergence. second half is to get your comments on the orignal EM paper.
                       Alert: you need to read the EM paper before Wed class since I may ask each of you to express your opinion.</li>
            <li>Week6: Feb 14th, I will meet with two who signed up.</li>
            <li>week7: Feb 19th, I will present the following 3 papers:
                (1)Hoerl, Arthur E., and Robert W. Kennard. "Ridge regression: Biased estimation for nonorthogonal problems." Technometrics 12.1 (1970): 55-67.
                (2)Hoerl, Roger W. "Ridge regression: a historical context." Technometrics 62.4 (2020): 420-425
                (3)Hastie, Trevor. "Ridge regularization: An essential concept in data science." Technometrics 62.4 (2020): 426-433.
                  the last two are discussions on the historical work in 1970 with a modern lense.</li>

            <li>week8: Feb 28th, meet with students.</li>
            <li>week9: Mar 5th, I will present a talk called "inspiration, aspiration, ambition'. slides are in the content section. part of it has materials on jackknife.</li>
            <li>week9: Mar 7th, 1v1 meeting.</li>
            <li>week10: Mar 12th, I will present Efron's bootstrap paper. </li>
            <li>week10: Mar 14th, I will present my 1986 AoS paper: resampling methods for regression analysis.</li>
            <li>week11: Mar 19th, Dr. Deng Linsui will give a lecture about HEI. </li>
            <li>week11: Mar 21th, a vidoe of my talk on using UQ and ML to solve a problem in rocket injector will be played. </li>
            <li>week12: Mar 26th, Tinko Sebastian will present the paper “Stable Signal Recovery from Incomplete and Inaccurate Measurements” by Emmanuel Candes, Justin Romberg, Terence Tao. </li>
            <li>week12: Mar 28th, we will go back to review two papers i covered in class: the paper by Hastie on ridge regression, Efron's bootstrap paper. read them again before class because i may ask you to give comments on them. </li>
            <li>week13: Apr 2nd, On wed the presentation will be on the MIT course notes on Reinforcement Learning by Foster and Rakhlin. The presentation will be divided into two parts:
                Ch 5. Reinforcement Learning: Basics, presenter: Yuanhao Zhu
                Ch 6. General Decision Making, presenter: Xiaoxian Ding </li>
            <li>week13: Apr 4th, no class, Qingming holiday.(Make-up on April 27th) </li>
            <li>week14: Apr 9th, will be given by Wang Chunxuan on the two papers.Rubin, D. B. (1974). Estimating causal effects of treatments in randomized and nonrandomized studies. Journal of educational Psychology, 66(5), 688.
                     Rosenbaum, P. R., & Rubin, D. B. (1983). The central role of the propensity score in observational studies for causal effects. Biometrika, 70(1), 41-55. </li>
